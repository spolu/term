The VT100 Strikes Back
Fostering innovation related to terminal emulation

Terminals are used everyday by hundred of thousands of developers and probably 
millions of people (remember that dark or blue screen they have when you book a 
ticket or ask for a search in a shop inventory?). Yet this technology is mainly 
stuck in the 70s when DEC introduced the DEC VT100 whose protocol became the 
standard that is still used today. No issue here, except for the fact that this 
is a complicated protocol that is not impossible, but hard to implement.

I started working a few weeks ago on a “new” terminal emulator, with the almost 
grandiloquent goal to make it to terminal emulation what Sublime is to text 
edition.
